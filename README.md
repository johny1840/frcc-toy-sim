# FRCC Toy Simulation

This is a minimalist simulation framework for testing concepts from the Fractal Recursive Computational Cosmology (FRCC) model.

## Features
- Node-based lattice structure
- Recursive update logic based on local information density
- Fractal-inspired neighbor connectivity
- Command-line arguments for steps, node count, and output path
- CSV output for tracking node states and entropy

## Usage
```bash
python main.py --nodes 100 --steps 10 --output data/
# frcc-toy-sim
